# Exercise 19_9

This application is supposed generate 1,000,000 integers and sort them using Radix Sort.

## Analysis Steps

Find out how to perform RadixSort and what it does. Started writing what I knew, and referred to e-book
for help.

### Design

In this design I was able to get all of my code onto the same page using only one class. I used array lists to generate the 
integers and implemented what I had learned to be radix sort.


### Testing
With this small method there wasn't very much testing that needed to happen. 
I just built and ran the application to ensure the
data had sorted correctly.

Explain any issues or testing instructions.
There were no issues developing this method.
