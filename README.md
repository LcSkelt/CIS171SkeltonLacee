# Skelton Black Jack

This application is to simulate the card game Black Jack.

## Analysis Steps

During analysis I wrote down what i would need, the classes that would be needed, and how I would bring it all together in the pane.
I had to figure out what the computer would do if I lost, busted, or won. I also had to figure out if this would be a game that you could
only play a couple of hands or if you could keep playing as long as you would like.

### Design
I found pictures off of google of each card to add to my resources to make the game more realistic. I also found a poker table on the internet 
that I included for my background. I started building a class for each aspect of the game (suit, rank,hand,card,etc) and set paramaters for
generating cards, the amount of cards given, etc.


### Testing
I tested this application many times. I tested after every class was built to ensure lack of errors.


Explain any issues or testing instructions.
There were no issues developing this method.
