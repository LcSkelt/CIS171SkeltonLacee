# Exercise 31-9

This application is created as a two sided chat between "Client" and "Server".

## Analysis Steps

Decide the classes and functions that were needed and make a list of the required output of both sides.

### Design

Create a "Client" side of the chat with a window that only allows the user to type in the client section which is sent to the server and 
displayed as a message to the "server". Create a "Server" side of the chat with a window that only allows the user to type in the "server" section
which is then sent to the client as a reply and displayed as a reply to the client.


### Testing
Testing was done in increments during the development phase of both sides. In the end I tested to ensure both "client" and "server" sides
are working and displayed correctly.

Explain any issues or testing instructions.
There were no issues developing this method.
