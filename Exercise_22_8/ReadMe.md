# Exercise 228


## Analysis Steps

Produce an application that produces random prime numbers up to 100,000

### Design

I designed the class to test all numbers to see if they are prime or not. Then to only display the prime numbers.


### Testing
I created a test file to ensure that the code was correctly written as well as the calcuations.

Explain any issues or testing instructions.
There were no issues developing this method.
