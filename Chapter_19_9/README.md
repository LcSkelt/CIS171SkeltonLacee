#Exercise 19.8 & 19.9


This application is supposed to serve as a support to Chapter 19.8 exercise. This application 
is made to sort data after it has been shuffled.

## Analysis Steps

The questions and answers were easy, the question was how to shuffle and sort the  data with generics.
The book walks you through the rest.

### Design

In this design I just added an extra class on to the previous code and assignment in order to make it
function with the previous code that was given.


### Testing
With this small methods there wasn't very much testing that needed to happen. 
I just used it with existing code, built, and ran the application to ensure the
data had sorted correctly.

Explain any issues or testing instructions.
There were no issues developing this method.
