# Exercise 19_9

This application generates a flag and shows it raising.

## Analysis Steps

This application is extended from 15.13. Set scene, stage, pane.

### Design

I found the flag on the internet and saved it in the corresponding folder. Used what I have learned about javaFX
in order to slowly raise the flag.


### Testing
With this small method there wasn't very much testing that needed to happen. 
I just built and ran the application to ensure the
window displayed properly and that the flag was raising.

Explain any issues or testing instructions.
There were no issues developing this method.
